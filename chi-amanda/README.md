# Kilovolt Blog "Lab 06: jQuery AJAX and JSON"

**Author**: ZhenChi Wu and Amanda Moen
**Version**: 1.1.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This application uses AJAX to grab the local storage data, and renders it into the blog.  If local storage doesn't exist, it will pull the data from the attached JSON file and render that data onto the HTML, and pushes to local storage.
Experience with building a personal blog, so we can generate our content, filter by author and category.


## Getting Started
Clone the repository, run live-server.

## Architecture
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, JSON, AJAX, live-server, etc.
